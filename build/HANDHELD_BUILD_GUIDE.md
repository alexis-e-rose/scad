## PETG Material Benefits for Gaming Handheld

### Why PETG is Ideal for This Project
- **Durability**: Superior impact resistance vs PLA - essential for gaming device
- **Chemical Resistance**: Won't degrade from hand oils and cleaning
- **Temperature Stability**: Won't warp in car or hot environments (60°C glass transition)
- **Layer Adhesion**: Excellent strength between layers - no delamination risk
- **Surface Quality**: Natural slight gloss provides premium feel
- **Flexibility**: Won't crack under stress like PLA might
- **Precision**: Excellent dimensional accuracy for tight tolerances

### PETG Considerations
- **Print Time**: Slower than PLA but higher quality results
- **Temperature**: Higher temps required (240°C nozzle, 85°C bed)
- **Stringing**: Requires proper retraction tuning
- **Cost**: More expensive than PLA but worth it for this application
